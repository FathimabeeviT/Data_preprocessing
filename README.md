SUMMERY

Importing and Exploring the Dataset
Load the dataset using pd.read_csv() and check the structure of the data using methods like info(), head(), isnull().sum(), and describe() to get a sense of missing values, basic statistics, and unique value counts in categorical columns.

Rename columns for better readability using rename() to give more meaningful names to your variables like Emp_age, Emp_salary, etc.

Data Cleaning
Remove duplicates: identify and remove duplicate rows using duplicated().sum() and drop_duplicates(). Handle missing values: Drop rows where Comp_name is missing. Fill missing values in the Emp_age column with 0. Fill missing values in Emp_salary with the column's mean. Fill missing values in Emp_place using the most frequent value (mode). Check the final shape of the dataset after cleaning to ensure the data has been processed correctly.

Outliers Detection
Box plots and histograms: Use seaborn and matplotlib to visualize the distribution of features like Emp_salary and Emp_age. Box plots help in detecting outliers, and histograms show the data distribution.

Skewness: compute skewness for numerical features to see how much the distribution deviates from normal.

Data Analysis
Filter Data: filter the dataset for employees whose age is greater than 40 and salary is less than 5000 using conditions in Pandas.

Visualizations: Plot the relationship between age and salary using plt.plot() to see any trends.

Bar chart: Show the distribution of employees across different places with a bar plot using plt.bar().

Data Encoding
Label Encoding: apply label encoding on categorical columns like Emp_place and Comp_name to convert them into numerical values using LabelEncoder() from sklearn.preprocessing.

Feature Scaling
MinMax Scaling: scale the Emp_age column to fit within a range (0-1) using* MinMaxScaler()*.

Standard Scaling: scale the Emp_salary column to have zero mean and unit variance using StandardScaler(). The scaled data is then plotted using histograms to visualize the transformed distributions.

Final Output:

This dataset has been cleaned, encoded, and scaled, making it ready for further machine learning tasks. It have visualized important aspects of the data and handled key preprocessing steps like missing values, duplicates, outliers, and feature scaling.
